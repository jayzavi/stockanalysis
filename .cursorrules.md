# Project: Council of LLMs Stock Research App

## Tech Stack
- Next.js, Tailwind CSS, OpenRouter API, Tavily Search.

- UI: Clean, dashboard-style (Tailwind CSS) that shows the live "debate" from each model.

## Architecture Rules:

-Implement an asynchronous multi-agent flow. All "Specialist" agents must run in parallel to minimize latency.
-The "Chairman" agent must wait for all specialists to finish before generating the final summary.
- The council of agents must leverage the following 3 agents: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Flash.

## AI Instructions
- Always use asynchronous parallel calls for the Specialist Agents.
- Ensure every claim has a URL citation from the search results.
- For complex logic: break it into sub-problems, assign confidence scores, and verify before combining.
